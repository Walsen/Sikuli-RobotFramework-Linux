This is an example on how to set up an environment with Robot Framework and Sikuli.

Compile the OpenCV sources and put all the libraries into the /lib directory,
edit the opencv.conf file, modify the line to your projects /lib directory and copy it
to /etc/ld.so.config.d/ finally run ldconfig as root.
